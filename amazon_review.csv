0,Xoxoxo,"Got the faulty laptop with display bleeding issue.First impressions:If you're think this is an ultra book, you ar wrong. Its quite thick and heavy. Completely made of plastic. Atleast for me the laptop frizzed couple of times. Camera is awful. Keyboard feedback 0, could have been beter.Asked Amazon for replacement, for the screen issue, not sure what is wrong with them, they are sending technician and then they will decide.Verdict: i would prefer to get refund as i feel in this prolice range you can get better build and quality laptopUpdate with the replacement laptop as on 16th Ocr 21:The replacement laptop is also defective. Same issue with the screen. I'm returning the laptop and getting refund."
1,Sankha,"Very poor camera quality and not satisfied with this laptop performance. Amazon not specified about camera details in their website, manufacturer cheated amazon, amazon cheated customer."
2,Sankha,Been using this for about 3 weeks now. Product looks good in pics but is a bit flimsy and very basic audio quality. I had bought this for online schooling purposes but laptop speakers are barely loud to hear the teachers voice so o am having to use additional speakers to solve the issue. Wonder why laptop makers go so miserly on such basic things. I can understand we cannot expect a BnO level audio but even boat speakers are better!!However the god points being the hardware confit which gives u ssd and hdd so start up is quick. In summary:Pros:1. Good ssd and hdd configuration will give you faster speeds2. Built in office package3. 3 USB ports and type c connectivity4. I5 processor at high clock speedsCons:1. Pricing could be much  lower given the overall package i bought it for base price of about 55k2. Plastic buddy not very sturdy. I have a Lenovo ideapad which is also plastic but much sturdier than this3. Below average audio4. Very average webcam5. Below par  Audio and video combination kill the basic purpose of online schooling

4,ashish k.,"To be honest first I didn't expect this to be so good, in the starting I was worried about the product because many times we come across fraud cases but my product was genuine thank you amazon for building the trustThis laptop is especially for the college students who are into designing, ott platform, online classes, keeping records, coding etcTrust me this combination was pretty good  SSD+HTD for the long run especially for students like me*Pros*â€¢Perfect size to carry everywhere (14inch) feels like an A4 register heheâ€¢The keyboard feel is love, the chiklet keyboard omg ðŸ’œðŸ’œâ€¢Screen is amazingâ€¢The upper body is metallic and the lower body is of strong built plasticâ€¢Mc antivirus is free of costâ€¢Lifetime MS Office 2019â€¢Windows 11 free update (although I'm using it and it's pretty good)*Cons*â€¢Speakers can be better(the sound is average you can watch a movie and the best part is the sound quality is amazing, clarity is there which makes sense for me as compared to the sound level)â€¢Battery backup is okay okay (still discovering the new options to stable it)~Conclusion: if you are looking for an overall laptop with the best features then you must give it a try (trust me I've gone through a lot while searching for laptops and now I don't want others to suffer so just list up your demands then choose the best option for you) no machine is good or bad it demands upon the person who is looking after it.Don't forget to order a laptop sleeve or case as the metallic body catches fingerprints quickly and try to put a transparent sheet or skin on it to protect the body."
5,mabby,"Good laptop. A combination of SSD and HDD at this price range. Start up and shutdown is lightning fast due to SDD but then the laptop itself is slow from day 1 so HDD I guess is not quite up to the mark.Screen quality is goodSize and weight of the laptop is perfect.If you need it for casual work (i.e. some non office work), daily browsing, some light movie and gaming, then this is a perfect laptop."
6,Xoxoxo,"Customer Service is the worst. Employees do not understand simple questions. Faced a lot of issues within 2 months of purchasing the system.  They never provide a permanent solution, nor do they reply to queries honestly. Higher ups a generally unaware of the issue and start queries a fresh leading to delays in response.Overall not good experience, not worth buying the system, as the same is not very reliable and trusty and dealing with after sales service is waste of your time.Will give 1 star for reliability of the system."

9,syam kumar,"Â That is max volume, so it is not good"
10,MS,"Amazon, pls don't sell this product and waste people's hard earned money.This feedback should go to the manufacturer immediately.Design flaw to print grey letters on a silver background that the keyboard letter prints are visible only from particular angle. With no backlit keyboard, you will struggle to see the letters on the keys in different lighting conditions. Please don't buy this product."
11,SURIYA,1  Speaker and mic volume is too low and cannot use for online classes if you want avoid using headphones.2. The keyboard keys are not clear and letters printed not clear in normal light. Its difficult to use this laptop if user does not know typing.3. The camera resolution is too low  and not even worth for zoom meeting.
