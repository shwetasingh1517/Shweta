0,Xoxoxo,"To be honest first I didn't expect this to be so good, in the starting I was worried about the product because many times we come across fraud cases but my product was genuine thank you amazon for building the trustThis laptop is especially for the college students who are into designing, ott platform, online classes, keeping records, coding etcTrust me this combination was pretty good  SSD+HTD for the long run especially for students like me*Pros*â€¢Perfect size to carry everywhere (14inch) feels like an A4 register heheâ€¢The keyboard feel is love, the chiklet keyboard omg ðŸ’œðŸ’œâ€¢Screen is amazingâ€¢The upper body is metallic and the lower body is of strong built plasticâ€¢Mc antivirus is free of costâ€¢Lifetime MS Office 2019â€¢Windows 11 free update (although I'm using it and it's pretty good)*Cons*â€¢Speakers can be better(the sound is average you can watch a movie and the best part is the sound quality is amazing, clarity is there which makes sense for me as compared to the sound level)â€¢Battery backup is okay okay (still discovering the new options to stable it)~Conclusion: if you are looking for an overall laptop with the best features then you must give it a try (trust me I've gone through a lot while searching for laptops and now I don't want others to suffer so just list up your demands then choose the best option for you) no machine is good or bad it demands upon the person who is looking after it.Don't forget to order a laptop sleeve or case as the metallic body catches fingerprints quickly and try to put a transparent sheet or skin on it to protect the body."

Start up and shutdown is lightning fast due to SDD but then the laptop itself is slow from day 1 so HDD I guess is not quite up to the mark.Screen quality is goodSize and weight of the laptop is perfect.If you need it for casual work (i.e. some non office work), daily browsing, some light movie and gaming, then this is a perfect laptop."
2,Ashutosh kumar,"At price of 46,126 this pc dilevers very value for money performance.Iris xe 4GB graphics is also decent .Boots up in 7 sec, heats up in casual gaming so it is not for gaming gives battery approx 4.5 hrs ( while playing YouTube on earphones).Not for Gaming.Best for coding. Small and powerful."
